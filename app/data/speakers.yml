    "In games, a valuable team is made up of characters with varied talents and skills. They need to be adaptable, to communicate, and most of all, to work together. As a team, they can accomplish even the most intimidating quests. It's time we took this mentality to the open source community.
    </p><p>
    Roleplaying games can teach us a lot about diversity and working as a team if we dig a little deeper. In such games, players take on the role of a fantasy character and participate in quests and adventures with a group of other players. During this talk I will take popular fantasy classes and relate them to the variety of people that contribute to open source communities every day. Just like a roleplaying party would fail with only type of character, open source needs the unsung heroes: the technical writers, the artists, the testers—to make the project a reality. By building our "party" around diverse interests and welcoming newcomers with open arms, open source communities can prosper."

    "Technical debt is frustrating, and can be downright crippling when attempting to implement new feature sets within
    an existing framework, construct new frameworks that interact with legacy applications, and/or conduct bug fixes.
    <br><br>
    We hem and haw to our peers, our managers about technical debt and the need to refactor - and most times, this is
    greeted with the response of the nodding and agreement about the pain - but nothing gets done about it because
    it's the directors, the non-technical product managers, and the board members that ultimately direct the upcoming
    tasks and priorities for development.
    <br><br>
    And they want new shiny things. They don't understand the ball of mud.
    <br><br>
    The experience of explaining technical issues (but folks aren't listening) is a frustrating one. Most times, it's
    not their fault - they just don't understand the fundamental technical reasons for why refactors are needed. They
    understand their realms, and most times these realms deal only with the time it takes to ship code, the
    monetization of a code base, or both.
    <br><br>
    That's why you need to supply additional information about why the technical debt matters - specifically, show
    them the money and time they are losing by not addressing aspects of the technical debt.
    <br><br>
    In my talk, I will go into the nitty gritty of the creation of a cost/benefit analysis document geared towards
    supplying non-technical people with the information they need in order to understand and appropriately react to
    the reality of the organization's code-based albatross. This will include in depth metrics and data points you can
    use to effectively get the point across that these issues are important."

    "Too often we get caught up in our own biases, even the most compassionate of us. When we do, we lose sight of how to design and build platforms and experiences that work for all our users. We end up building for ourselves, the person who knows the system inside and out, the power user. And while people like us are important, they rarely make up the majority of users. We need to build things that anyone can learn quickly, use efficiently, make the user feel confident and powerful. Through examples of atypical users, I’ll walk through things to consider when designing tools and applications that empower the greatest number of users to achieve more."

    "In the tech industry and especially in the open source community, there are many frustrations and problems that everyone experiences. It is no secret, however, that these problems are not evenly distributed. Those who tend to be underrepresented in the industry find their feelings of marginalization are compounded by behavior that has come to be viewed as the norm. And while it is also no secret that speaking out about these issues can in itself be a problem it is not as simple as it seems. Will standing up to injustice harm your career? Are harassment and *-ism just something you should expect? Is there a certain initiation/hazing period that you have to simply suffer through before you can be taken seriously? Do certain marginalized subgroups have it worse than others, and does what does that mean for those who don't have it the worst? In this talk, we'll take a deep dive into the many not-often-discussed nuances of a widely-known problem."

    "Identifying and discouraging negative self-talk is a simple thing, but it can have a huge impact on your community in a positive way. It increases self-confidence, improves morale, and generally results in happier, more productive community participants. This, in turn, will make you happy.
    Negative self-talk is a pervasive, invasive, and unproductive way of thinking. It can trigger a cascade of things, from abandoned patches (“I am not smart/talented/good enough to figure this out”), to withdrawl from the community (“I screwed this up and everyone knows and hates me”), to general discouragement (“I suck, and have nothing valuable to contribute here”).
    <br><br>
    In this talk, I’ll discuss the various methods Dreamwidth and other organizations use to handle negative self-talk, and the best way to deploy those techniques. I will also discuss things to keep an eye out for in your community that may be at the root of this type of self-talk, and processes you can go through to eliminate them. Finally, there will be a quick overview of impostor syndrome, and the role it plays here."

    True legends don't form from one successful deploy, or one successful workshop run. Success is dictated by longevity and key points of interest.

    Now that you've figured out and climbed your mountain, how are you going to keep your project alive? How can you ensure stability?
    <br><br>
    In 2013, I set out with a very manageable goal of running a RailsBridge workshop in New York City. The second part of my goal was to create a self-sustaining organization that would continue to run workshops to teach the underrepresented minorities in tech while keeping the values set by the RailsBridge founders Sarah Mei and Sarah Allen.
    <br><br>
    It's easy to run workshops, it's a lot harder to develop a healthy culture within a volunteer organization.
    <br><br>
    In this talk I will highlight key points from my two years of as a RailsBridge chapter founder and go through the challenges I faced through strategies in real-time communication, documentation, and code curriculum sharing through technology.
    <br><br>
    The points highlighted are - What is your mission statement? - In one year what do you intend to accomplish? - How do you measure success? - Learning to collaborate and taking suggestions - When to be aware that certain suggestions might not be helpful - Always come back to your mission statement. Don't lose focus. - Planting seeds - Getting comfortable with delegating - When delegating doesn't work - Learning when to let go"

    that living on the intersection of race and gender were seldom addressed in tech initiatives, and in work spaces
    I seldom encountered other professional women of color outside of the service staff. In an effort to get over the
    feelings of isolation, a friend and I created a Twitter chat using the then-underused #WOCinTech hashtag in an
    effort to bridge the geographic and workplace barriers and connect with women of color already in the tech
    industry and connect with each other. The chat has since grown to become a full-fledged community made up of women
    of color and nonbinary POC technologists, and our two-person team has responded to the needs of this community by
    creating initiatives that target these groups specifically.

    In my talk, I'll discuss my experiences living at the intersection of race and gender, the #WOCinTech chat origin

UX Designers and Software developers can use these same techniques to uncover their users' needs, manage volunteers, communicate effectively, and prioritize development.

    "We interact with people in chat rooms, issue trackers, pull requests, discussion boards, meetups, hallways, or conferences. How do we provide feedback constructively? Are we perceived as friendly as we think we are? How exactly do our cognitive biases unconsciously affect our human interactions? How do we become conscious of them? What assumptions does our language carry? Effective communication is critical particularly for project leaders. As leaders, we open the doors to our gardens, and the first interactions define the tone for the group, shaping today's atmosphere as much as tomorrow's. In this talk, we'll explore how to communicate effectively. Always, and with everyone."
