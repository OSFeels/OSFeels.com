    "In games, a valuable team is made up of characters with varied talents and skills. They need to be adaptable, to communicate, and most of all, to work together. As a team, they can accomplish even the most intimidating quests. It's time we took this mentality to the open source community.
    </p><p>
    Roleplaying games can teach us a lot about diversity and working as a team if we dig a little deeper. In such games, players take on the role of a fantasy character and participate in quests and adventures with a group of other players. During this talk I will take popular fantasy classes and relate them to the variety of people that contribute to open source communities every day. Just like a roleplaying party would fail with only type of character, open source needs the unsung heroes: the technical writers, the artists, the testers—to make the project a reality. By building our 'party' around diverse interests and welcoming newcomers with open arms, open source communities can prosper."

    In this session, you'll learn real stuff about what's in your own heart, and how to connect to the people you encounter. Less feeling shitty, more enjoying projects!"

We'll talk about reporting processes, documentation, creating a team or committee to handle reports, what responses are or aren't effective, and dealing with problems in the heat of the moment."

    "Technical debt is frustrating, and can be downright crippling when attempting to implement new feature sets within
    an existing framework, construct new frameworks that interact with legacy applications, and/or conduct bug fixes.
    <br><br>
    We hem and haw to our peers, our managers about technical debt and the need to refactor - and most times, this is
    greeted with the response of the nodding and agreement about the pain - but nothing gets done about it because
    it's the directors, the non-technical product managers, and the board members that ultimately direct the upcoming
    tasks and priorities for development.
    <br><br>
    And they want new shiny things. They don't understand the ball of mud.
    <br><br>
    The experience of explaining technical issues (but folks aren't listening) is a frustrating one. Most times, it's
    not their fault - they just don't understand the fundamental technical reasons for why refactors are needed. They
    understand their realms, and most times these realms deal only with the time it takes to ship code, the
    monetization of a code base, or both.
    <br><br>
    That's why you need to supply additional information about why the technical debt matters - specifically, show
    them the money and time they are losing by not addressing aspects of the technical debt.
    <br><br>
    In my talk, I will go into the nitty gritty of the creation of a cost/benefit analysis document geared towards
    supplying non-technical people with the information they need in order to understand and appropriately react to
    the reality of the organization's code-based albatross. This will include in depth metrics and data points you can
    use to effectively get the point across that these issues are important."

As a primary person involved with Read the Docs (the largest open source doc hosting website), and Write the Docs (the largest OSS doc conference), I have seen a lot of angles, and appreciate documentation more every year.
    </p><p>
    I believe better documentation is a fundamental aspect of how we can improve programming culture, and an often misunderstood part of outreach and education. Projects with good documentation are able to get contributors in a much more reliable fashion, and more importantly, projects without documentation only attract users who have time to waste.
    </p><p>
    This talk will make you think more deeply about the social impact of documentation, and hopefully make you question if it should be a higher priority in your development. You should understand the role of documentation in both technical as well as social realms."

We end up building for ourselves, the person who knows the system inside and out, the power user. And while people like us are important, they rarely make up the majority of users. We need to build things that anyone can learn quickly, use efficiently, make the user feel confident and powerful. Through examples of atypical users, I’ll walk through things to consider when designing tools and applications that empower the greatest number of users to achieve more."

    "In the tech industry and especially in the open source community, there are many frustrations and problems that everyone experiences. It is no secret, however, that these problems are not evenly distributed. Those who tend to be underrepresented in the industry find their feelings of marginalization are compounded by behavior that has come to be viewed as the norm. And while it is also no secret that speaking out about these issues can in itself be a problem it is not as simple as it seems. Will standing up to injustice harm your career? Are harassment and *-ism just something you should expect? Is there a certain initiation/hazing period that you have to simply suffer through before you can be taken seriously? Do certain marginalized subgroups have it worse than others, and does what does that mean for those who don't have it the worst? In this talk, we'll take a deep dive into the many not-often-discussed nuances of a widely-known problem."

    </p><p>
    This talk will introduce Non-Violent Communication as a toolkit for helping users at their worst, and also prevent the flood of bad vibes from becoming a source of toxicity. By exposing our vulnerability in a direct and honest way, we can turn conversations away from blame and antagonism, towards meaningful connection and opportunities for growth and collaboration. Open Source is a social machine, and compassion helps keep the gears from grinding to a halt."

And, yet, we’re out there, willing, capable and ready, trying to find our ways in anyway. If we truly want to improve the diversity of our tech communities, we need to talk about how childcare responsibilities disproportionately affect the marginalized, and how to have more empathy for those with those responsibilities. Let’s talk about how to create successfully family-inclusive events, how to care for the carers, and how we can all work together to build a strong, open pathway for the next generation."

    "Identifying and discouraging negative self-talk is a simple thing, but it can have a huge impact on your community in a positive way. It increases self-confidence, improves morale, and generally results in happier, more productive community participants. This, in turn, will make you happy.
    Negative self-talk is a pervasive, invasive, and unproductive way of thinking. It can trigger a cascade of things, from abandoned patches (“I am not smart/talented/good enough to figure this out”), to withdrawl from the community (“I screwed this up and everyone knows and hates me”), to general discouragement (“I suck, and have nothing valuable to contribute here”).
    <br><br>
    In this talk, I’ll discuss the various methods Dreamwidth and other organizations use to handle negative self-talk, and the best way to deploy those techniques. I will also discuss things to keep an eye out for in your community that may be at the root of this type of self-talk, and processes you can go through to eliminate them.

Don't lose focus. - Planting seeds - Getting comfortable with delegating - When delegating doesn't work - Learning when to let go"

    that living on the intersection of race and gender were seldom addressed in tech initiatives, and in work spaces
    I seldom encountered other professional women of color outside of the service staff. In an effort to get over the
    feelings of isolation, a friend and I created a Twitter chat using the then-underused #WOCinTech hashtag in an
    effort to bridge the geographic and workplace barriers and connect with women of color already in the tech
    industry and connect with each other. The chat has since grown to become a full-fledged community made up of women
    of color and nonbinary POC technologists, and our two-person team has responded to the needs of this community by
    creating initiatives that target these groups specifically.
