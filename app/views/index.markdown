    <h4>Why feelings?</h4>
    <p>Being a coder can be emotionally difficult. Some of us talk about it with others, but many of us don’t and aren’t encouraged to.

    <h4>Why open source <i>and</i> feelings?</h4>
    <p>Open Source and Feelings is about taking the existing legacy of open source and crafting its culture into what we want it to be. This means developing strategies and solutions and building the skills that will help us do this work as a community.</p>
